# 100 Days Of Code - Kristin's Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2018 
##### Coffee & Code with Jordan

**Today's Progress**: Got through entire HTML section in freecodecamp. Lots of basic info on tags, elements, and what the hell HTML actually is.

**Thoughts:** Brushed up on some old knowledge and learned some new things from Jordan giving me background info and extra tips and tricks. Nice to be learning and starting fresh on the new freecodecamp curriculum.
