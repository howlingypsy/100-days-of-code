# 100 Days Of Code - Kristin's Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2018 
##### Coffee & Code with Jordan

**Today's Progress**: Got through entire HTML section in freecodecamp. Lots of basic info on tags, elements, and what the hell HTML actually is.

**Thoughts:** Brushed up on some old knowledge and learned some new things from Jordan giving me background info and extra tips and tricks. Nice to be learning and starting fresh on the new freecodecamp curriculum. 


### Day 2: June 5, 2018
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I worked through part of the CSS section in freecodecamp (took about 30 mins). Intro into styling elements, classes, using external sources for fonts, etc. Briefly touched on ids.

**Thoughts**: Starting to remember bits and pieces from my first go at it. I feel it is definitely making more sense this time around. I am a little disappointed I only put in about 30 mins of coding today, but in light of life happening and wifi issues, I am glad I still decided to code, even if just for a little bit. Some time and effort is better than nothing at all!


### Day 3: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did some digging around on w3schools HTML tutorials. I looked through a lot of the pages that gave more depth and background into what I have already been learning with freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: I liked getting another perspective and more background on some of the HTML lessons I have already done. I feel like a have a bit of a broader perspective as to how the language works. Also, I was really tired and didn't feel up to really digging into something new, so I chose to go for some light reading and research into the basics.

### Day 4: June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  I did a bunch of practice examples for HTML on the W3Schools website. 

**Thoughts**: Definitely feel I have a much better grasp on basic HTML. A lot of the practice examples were easy, but some made me go back and learn more in depth some of the ways to change elements as well as some other nifty tricks like line breaks and text formatting.
